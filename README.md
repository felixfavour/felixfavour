### Hi, I'm Favour, Felix.

You'd find me [building software](https://favourfelix.com/projects) interwoven between my personal beliefs and exuberant mundanity.

### My Interests
I'm more interested in AI, but not the generative kind for now. 

I'm also keen on learning the workings of WASM—it's one of the billion things I've never explored in my years of experience building apps on the Web (and I'm not even counting the new daily JS frameworks).

I love to have conversations about web technologies, and some say I have expert knowledge of the Vue framework.

### 🎹🎸🥁

**Fun fact**: I play the piano, guitar and drums, yet I'm not nearly as good as the worst professionals in any of them :)
